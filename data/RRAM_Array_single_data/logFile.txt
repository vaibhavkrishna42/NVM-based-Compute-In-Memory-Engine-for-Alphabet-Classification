 compiled source cache is valid
Analog module platform compile:
    [1] amswork.RRAM (valid object cache, no platform compile required)
    Analog module design library exists, no link required.

8 spare nodes and 8 spare devices are removed.
The details can be found in file 'C:\ADS\RRAM_Project\data\RRAM_Array_single_data\spare_removal.txt'.

Warning detected by hpeesofsim in topology check during circuit set up.
    Number of nodes with only one device attached (topology corrected): 8
    Topology correction added to 8 branches

    Matrix is singular (detected at node or branch `Cell_16_8.Gap').
    Matrix is singular (detected at node or branch `Cell_1__4.Gap').
The final gnode step did NOT converge in 1 iteration(s) with gnode=0.000000e+00
The solution with gnode=1.000000e-12 will be accepted
